# LCU Tool - Electron

This project intends to help people who use the League Client to make their lives easier and to facilitate boring tasks such as buying the first 20 initial champions to be able to play ranked matches in a fresh account!

*This project is in its initial stage, for now it can only automatically connect to LeagueClient without errors (and buy Yuumi! =D).*


Initial project based on: https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
